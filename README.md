# Node.js + TypeScript + ES modules + convenient dev development

This example shows how to integrate Node.js with TypeScript and to use with ES modules (no CommonJS).

For convenient development, just start `dev` package.json's script and your application will restart when the source code changes.

Testes with Node.js version `12.13.0`.

Most code in `tsconfig.json` is not important, except for the `module: "commonjs"`.

Hope this helps someone! :smile:
